# Shrimp Cultivation Monitoring and Forecasting for Jala Apps

This repository contains code and models for monitoring and forecasting shrimp cultivation used in Jala Apps.

## Description

This project utilizes machine learning to monitor and predict various aspects of shrimp cultivation, including:

- Shrimp growth
- Water quality
- Harvest yield forecasting
- Revenue forecasting

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/masdar/shrimp-cultivation-monitoring.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies. You can install the dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the Python notebook and trained model from [file_link] and save them in the project directory.

4. Open the Python notebook using Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE.

5. Run the cells in the notebook to perform monitoring and forecasting.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization
- `models/`: Contains trained machine learning models
- `data/`: Place to store datasets (not included in the repository)
- `scripts/`: Additional Python scripts for data processing and utilities

## Contribution

We welcome contributions to improve this project. Please create a pull request or open an issue if you have suggestions or find bugs.

## Future Development Plans

We plan to develop this project into a web-based application using Streamlit. An example of a similar implementation can be seen in our previous SAAS project: [ChatMarket](https://chatmarket.streamlit.app/)

Planned features include:
- User-friendly web interface for data input and result visualization
- Real-time dashboard for shrimp cultivation monitoring
- Integration with notification systems for early warnings
